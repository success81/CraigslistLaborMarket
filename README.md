Project Name: Craigslist Gig Analysis
Description: The Craigslist Gig section charges people a small fee to advertise different small jobs or opportunities. In this project I will analyze the Craigslist gig section for cities across the United States based on median household income.


1. Business Understanding.
Craigslist is a classified advertisement website established in 1995. Craigslist serves more than 20 billion page views per month(Source 1). 
2. Data Understanding.
In this project I analyze the Craigslist Gig Section in multiple cities across the United States. To ensure I get a representation of the United States population I will choose cities in each region of the country. I will pull household income data from the census.gov.(Source 2)


3. Data Preparation.
I will create a script using Python and the Beautiful Soup library that will scrape the titles from Craigslist gig posts. I will choose multiple cities in the United States broken down into the following categories:
* Northeast
* Southeast
* Midwest
* Southwest
* Pacific
* Noncontiguous
* Rocky Mountain
        After the cities are chosen I will determine the median and quartiles for the
        Median household income levels for the cities selected.
        I will also collect the poverty rate for each city.
4. Modeling.
I will pull explore the data and explore various hypotheses on the data.
5. Evaluation.
I will compare my hypotheses with the data.
6. Deployment.
I will create a presentation to share my findings
